WIQCA is a meetup group initially based in Seattle, but now reaches a global audience with our transition to all digital content!
All of our events are governed by our <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}code-of-conduct.md">Code of Conduct</a>, which will be reviewed by members periodically to ensure it best reflects the needs of the group.
Upcoming events are also listed on our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/wiqca-sea/">Meetup Page.
