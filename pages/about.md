Hi there! ðŸ”®ðŸŽ‰

This group is for folks who are interested in and excited about quantum computing in Seattle, WA.
We have meet-ups about once a month where we have speakers, hands-on tutorials, and open-source docs sprints.
Our group is an inclusive and welcoming, and emphasizes growing everyone's skills and abilities in quantum computing and open source development.
You can find our code of conduct that governs all of our events [here]({{ site.github.url }}/code-of-conduct.html).

For more information on what we do and upcoming events, check out [the events page]({{ site.github.url }}/pages/events.html) or our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/wiqca-sea/).
