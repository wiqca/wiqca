This will be the first installment in the Quantum 101 talk series, featuring speakers giving inclusive introductions to quantum computing and related topics.

For the first session, Dr. Sarah Kaiser (Pensar Development) will get you up and running with quantum computing through a hands-on workshop, and tutorials to help understand what's going on. Install instructions/pre-talk setup instructions coming soon.
