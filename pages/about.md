Hi there! ðŸ”®ðŸŽ‰

This group is for folks who are interested and excited about quantum computing.
We have meet-ups about once a month where we have speakers, hands-on tutorials, and other events that our members suggest.
Our group is an inclusive and welcoming, and emphasizes growing everyone's skills and abilities in quantum computing and open source development.
You can find our code of conduct that governs all of our events [here]({{ site.github.url }}/code-of-conduct.html).

Are you interested in giving a talk at a WIQCA event?
We are always looking for speakers who can help this awesome community learn and grow their skills!
Check out our resources for speakers, and the talk submission form here: [wiqca.dev/speakers](https://www.wiqca.dev/speakers/).

For more information on what we do and upcoming events, check out [the events page]({{ site.github.url }}/pages/events.html) or our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/wiqca-sea/).
