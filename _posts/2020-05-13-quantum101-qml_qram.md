> This is part of the Quantum 101 talk series, featuring speakers giving inclusive introductions to quantum computing and related topics.

In this installment of the Quantum 101 series Dr. Olivia Di Matteo will be introducing us to quantum machine learning and qRAM or quantum memory.

In this session, Olivia will talk about different meanings of the term ‚Äúquantum machine learning‚Äù, and introduce a component that is required for some of them: quantum RAM, or qRAM. A large-scale qRAM might be harder to build than we expect! She will outline some of the space-time tradeoffs involved, and highlight a couple ways to design a qRAM unit.

We will be hosting this event online, and as always, everyone is welcome at WIQCA events üíñ.
