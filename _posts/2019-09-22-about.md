Hi there! 
This group is for folks who are interested in and excited about quantum computing.
We have meetings in Seattle, WA, USA about every month where we have speakers, hands-on tutorials and open-source docs sprints.
Our group is an inclusive and welcoming, and emphasizes growing everyone's skills and abilities in quantum computing and open source development.
